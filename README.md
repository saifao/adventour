### Next Steps
- add feature to remove beers from the list (user-centric because it encourages participation)
- add feature to remove breweries assigned to a beer (not user-centric to utilize large user-base for most up-to-date information)
- add accordian navigation feature to improve UX
- use flexbox and grid to make the view more responsive to viewport size (including mobile)
